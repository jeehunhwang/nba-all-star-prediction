# NBA All-Star Prediction
By Jimmy Hwang

## Overview
Machine learning models were used to predict NBA All Star status using both traditional and advanced player statistics. The dataset covers the period from the NBA–ABA merger in the 1976–77 season through the 2024–25 season, with all data collected from Basketball Reference. The goal of this project is to classify players as an All Star or not across multiple seasons. Snub cases can also be identified where an All-Star is predicted by the model but the player was not selected.
